# Co-occurrence matrix construction and visualization:
Step:
1. collect the news data from [MoneyDJ理財網](https://www.moneydj.com/)
2. Adopt NER techniques to extract key word from the raw text
3. Construct a count-based term document matrix *A*
4. Calculate the term-term co-occurrence matrix

For the source code, please refer to [NER.ipynb](https://github.com/thtang/Fintech-Text-Mining-and-Machine-Learning/blob/master/hw2/NER.ipynb).
